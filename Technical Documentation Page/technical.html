<p>           Android Activity Lifecycle is controlled by 7 methods of android.app.Activity class. The android Activity is the subclass of ContextThemeWrapper class.
           </p>
           <p>
An activity is the single screen in android. It is like window or frame of Java.
           </p>
           <p>
By the help of activity, you can place all your UI components or widgets in a single screen.
           </p>
           <p>
The 7 lifecycle method of Activity describes how activity will behave at different states.
           </p>

    <header>Android Menu</header>
         <article>
           <p>
      The Android UI provides three basic menu types: The options menu is the one that appears when you click the menu button on older Android devices, or via the action bar at the top of the screen in newer ones (post 3.0). The options menu should handle global application actions that make sense for the whole app.</p>
           <p>
Android Option Menus are the primary menus of android. They can be used for settings, search, delete item etc.
           </p>
           <p>
Here, we are going to see two examples of option menus. First, the simple option menus and second, options menus with images.
           </p>
           <p>
Here, we are inflating the menu by calling the inflate() method of MenuInflater class. To perform event handling on menu items, you need to override onOptionsItemSelected() method of Activity class.

       <section class="main-section" id="android_fragments">
    <header>Android Fragments</header>
         <article>
    <p>  A Fragment is a piece of an activity which enable more modular activity design. It will not be wrong if we say, a fragment is a kind of sub-activity.</p>
           <br>Following are important points about fragment -
           <br>-A fragment has its own layout and its own behaviour with its own life cycle callbacks.

<br>-You can add or remove fragments in an activity while the activity is running.

<br>-You can combine multiple fragments in a single activity to build a multi-pane UI.

<br>-A fragment can be used in multiple activities.
<p>
Fragment life cycle is closely related to the life cycle of its host activity which means when the activity is paused, all the fragments available in the activity will also be stopped.
           </p>
           <p>
A fragment can implement a behaviour that has no user interface component.
           </p>
           <p>
Fragments were added to the Android API in Honeycomb version of Android which API version 11.

You create fragments by extending Fragment class and You can insert a fragment into your activity layout by declaring the fragment in the activity's layout file, as a <fragment> element.
             </p>
             <p>
Prior to fragment introduction, we had a limitation because we can show only a single activity on the screen at one given point in time. So we were not able to divide device screen and control different parts separately. But with the introduction of fragment we got more flexibility and removed the limitation of having a single activity on the screen at a time. Now we can have a single activity but each activity can comprise of multiple fragments which will have their own layout, events and complete life cycle.
           </p>
           <p>
Following is a typical example of how two UI modules defined by fragments can be combined into one activity for a tablet design, but separated for a handset design.

Android Internal Storage 
           <br>
<p>
We are able to save or read data from the device internal memory. FileInputStream and FileOutputStream classes are used to read and write data into the file.
           </p>
Here, we are going to read and write data to the internal storage of the device.
           
           
           <br>
           
Android External Storage
<p>
Like internal storage, we are able to save or read data from the device external memory such as sdcard. The FileInputStream and FileOutputStream classes are used to read and write data into the file.

    <header>Android SQLite</header>
         <article>
       <p> SQLite is an open-source relational database i.e. used to perform database operations on android devices such as storing, manipulating or retrieving persistent data from the database.</p>

<p>It is embedded in android bydefault. So, there is no need to perform any database setup or administration task.
           </p>
           <p>
Here, we are going to see the example of sqlite to store and fetch the data. Data is displayed in the logcat. For displaying data on the spinner or listview, move to the next page.
           </p>
           <p>
SQLiteOpenHelper class provides the functionality to use the SQLite database.

    <header>Android Graphics</header>
         <article>
     <p> The android.graphics.Canvas can be used to draw graphics in android. It provides methods to draw oval, rectangle, picture, text, line etc.
           </p>
           <p>
The android.graphics.Paint class is used with canvas to draw objects. It holds the information of color and style.
           </p>
In this example, we are going to display 2D graphics in android.
           </p>
         <p>
         The Android framework offers a variety of graphics rendering APIs for 2D and 3D that interact with manufacturer implementations of graphics drivers, so it is important to have a good understanding of how those APIs work at a higher level. This page introduces the graphics hardware abstraction layer (HAL) upon which those drivers are built.</p>

    <header>Android Animation</header>
         <article>
           <p>
        Android provides a large number of classes and interface for the animation development. Most of the classes and interfaces are given in android.animation package.
           </p>
           <p>
Android Animation enables you to change the object property and behavior at run time. There are various ways to do animation in android.
           </p>
           <p>
The AnimationDrawable class provides methods to start and end the animation. Even, you can use time based animation.
           </p>
           <p>
             Tween Animation
Tween Animation takes some parameters such as start value , end value, size , time duration , rotation angle e.t.c and perform the required animation on that object. It can be applied to any type of object. So in order to use this , android has provided us a class called Animation.
           </p>
           <p>
In order to perform animation in android , we are going to call a static function loadAnimation() of the class AnimationUtils. We are going to receive the result in an instance of Animation Object.

       <section class="main-section" id="google_map">
    <header>Google Map</header>
         <article>
      <p>Android provides facility to integrate Google map in our application. Google map displays your current location, navigate location direction, search location etc. We can also customize Google map according to our requirement.</p>
 *Types of Google Maps
<br>
There are four different types of Google maps, as well as an optional to no map at all. Each of them gives different view on map. These maps are as follow:

<br>-Normal: This type of map displays typical road map, natural features like river and some features build by humans.
<br>-Hybrid: This type of map displays satellite photograph data with typical road maps. It also displays road and feature labels.
<br>-Satellite: Satellite type displays satellite photograph data, but doesn't display road and feature labels.
<br>-Terrain: This type displays photographic data. This includes colors, contour lines and labels and perspective shading.
<br>-None: This type displays an empty grid with no tiles loaded.
